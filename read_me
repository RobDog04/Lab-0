My computer was having a great deal of trouble processing php inside of html so im not sure if everything looks correct, but i put an abundance of effort into this lab to see if i could get an A in the class.
I appoligize if things look a bit off, but taking a peek at the code may yield partial credit which could save my grade on ex. 6 and 7. thanks for everything this semester
